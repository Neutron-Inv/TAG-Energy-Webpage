          {{-- <p>TAG Energy is fully committed to adding value to the Nigerian Economy through the implementation of relevant provisions of Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act, 2010. Hence, a number of large diameters flanged joint in the LNG process trains had suffered sudden leaks leading to slowdowns with attendant production loses and environmental effects. Previous interventions utilized leak sealing and special gaskets to accommodate the movements but did not produce the leak tightness due to the relative “flexibility” and “relaxation” of these large diameter flanges.</p>
          <p>However, execution of the previous contract mitigated leakages on the Train 2 and Train 3 propane kettles by using James Walker Rotabolts and TAG Energy Managers, Engineers and Technicians.</p>
          <p>The objective of this research and development plan is to continue to use the bolting technology and experience of TAG/JW staff that executed the Train 2 and 3 propane kettles to permanently provide full leak-proof tightness for large diameter or problematic flanged joints on the NLNG equipment throughout the plant.</p>
